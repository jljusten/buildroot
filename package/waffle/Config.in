	  Waffle is a cross-platform C library that allows one to defer
	  selection of an OpenGL API and window system until runtime. For
	  example, on Linux, Waffle enables an application to select X11/EGL
	  with an OpenGL 3.3 core profile, Wayland with OpenGL ES2, and other
	  window system / API combinations.
